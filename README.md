This repository contains two programs that perform the following actions:

    1. The program main.py contained within the PyBank folder opens and reads a budget data csv and calculates:
            -total number of months
            -net total of profits/losses
            -changes in profits/losses and the average of those changes
            -greatest increase in profits
            -greatest decrease in profits
        The program prints all of this information to the command prompt as well as saving it to a text file.
    
    2. The program main.py contained within the PyPoll folder opens and reads an election data csv and calculates:
            -total number of votes cast
            -a complete list of candidates
            -total number of votes for each candidate and the percentage of the whole of those votes
            -the winner of the election
        The program prints all of this information to the command prompt as well as saving it to a text file.
